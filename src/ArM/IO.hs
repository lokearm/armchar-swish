-- Description :  Simple utilities to read and parse ArMChar files.
--
-- The functions in this module generally take a filename (String)
-- and returns a Maybe object by attempting to parse the relevant 
-- file.
--
-- Some objects, like the Spell Database, are stored in CSV, others
-- in JSON, including Character and Covenant.
