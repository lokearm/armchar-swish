A large and critical part of the logic is concerned with the individual character. We will therefore discuss that first, before we go into the management of covenants and sagas.
## The Character

+ The `Character Type` is provided by `ArM.Char.Character`.  It is a composite type, comprising
	+ a `CharacterConcept` (with permanent metadata like name and year of birth)
	+ a `CharacterState` (with current stats)
+ The character state is derived from a series of advancements.
	+ In the input from the user, the advancements are defined by `Advancement` objects, defined in `ArM.Internal.Advancement`. The `Character` object includes two lists of such objects.
		+ `pregameAdvancement` for CharGen advancement
		+ `futureAdvancement` for in-game advancement
	+ When the character state is computed, each `Advancement` object is augmented with inferred data and the result applied to the `CharacterState` to generate a new `CharacterState`.
	+ When a state is calculated, the advancements are removed from the input lists and added to new lists for augmented advancements
		+ `pregameDesign` for CharGen 
		+ `pastAdvancement` for in-game advancement
+ In principle, a character can be persisted at any stage of advancement, but this is not implemented yet.  When it is, it will allow saving startup time.
+ It is always possible to revert to a past state, since the original advancements are stored as part of `AugmentedAdvancement`
+ `CharacterState` contains
	+ list of traits
	+ current season
+ The `CharacterState` object stores all kinds of traits in one list. To process the character, we normally use `CharacterSheet` which is easily calculated from `CharacterState` and provides lists for each type of trait (art, ability, spell)

### Traits

+ Constituent types
	+ `ProtoTrait` represents advancement of a trait
	+ `Trait` represents a trait with computed scores
	+ `Advancement` represents advancement of a character or covenant
		+ includes a list of `ProtoTrait` advancing individual traits
		+ includes a time (season) or a stage (pregame)
		+ may include a narrative
		+ may include appearance, if it changes

### Advancement	

+ Advancement
	+ as entered by user
		+ season 
		+ totalXP
		+ uses (book)
		+ changes 

## Covenant and Saga
